Where did the WCBF come from?
-----------------------------

There had been a growing concern among many of the independent Baptist brethren in Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan that an association be developed in order to meet the unique needs of our pastors and congregations.  This concern was the basis of a meeting in the Spring of 1992 at the Prairie Baptist Church in Swift Current, Saskatchewan at which several pastors covenanted to pursue such an association.  The fellowship was chartered at the first annual conference in 1994.  Since that time, the fellowship has grown to include pastors from across four provinces.

It is our conviction that the Biblical concept of fellowship demands that we endeavour to keep the unity given us in the Spirit by challenging one another to live godly in Christ Jesus, by stirring one another up to be diligent in performing our pastoral duties, and by providing helpful information concerning the defection among brethren and unbelievers alike in our day.

What does the WCBF believe?
---------------------------

We believe that the sixty-six books of the Bible are divinely inspired in their original writing, and therefore the only rule for faith and practice.

We believe that there is only one God who exists in three persons:  Father, Son, and Spirit.  This God is spirit, infinite, unchangeable, omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent.  He is distinguished in His love, mercy and grace by His immutable justice and holiness.

We believe in the virgin birth, virtuous life, vicarious death, and victorious resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, Who is the Saviour of all who put their faith in Him.

We believe that all mankind are sinful by nature and by choice, and therefore under the just and eternal condemnation of God. However, anyone who will repent of sin and believe God will be saved from sin’s penalty, power and presence.

We believe that the local church is a congregation of baptized believers associated together by a common faith in the gospel for obedience to the Lord’s Word, observance of the Lord’s ordinances, and the extension of the Lord’s gospel to the ends of the earth.

(Please see the [constitution](/beliefs/constitution.html "Constitution") for a complete statement of faith.)

Why should I join the WCBF?
---------------------------

First, we believe that the fellowship is essential in these days and in our region.

Second, we believe that the information provided will be of great benefit to pastors and brethren in our day of compromise.

Third, we believe that your affiliation in his fellowship would enable us to plant more churches in western Canada.

Fourth, we believe that the WCBF can provide Scriptural fellowship for dissenting members of other denominations which have compromised the truth by their affiliation with disobedience.
