## COVID-19 update for 2020 conference

Unfortunately, the WCBF Conference for 2020 is cancelled due to the coronavirus.

## Location

Location: Mackenzie Highway Baptist Church.

Directions from Edmonton: 

* The route via Westlock, Slave Lake, & Red Earth Creek saves about 45 minutes. 
* The other option is to go through Whitecourt & Peace River. There are more places to stop along the way, and you get a divided highway for a couple hours, but it takes a little longer.
