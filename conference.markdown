## 2017 theme: Faithful Men

<blockquote>
	<p><strong><span>2 Timothy 2:1&ndash;2</span></strong> "Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also."</p>
</blockquote>

For 35 years Pastor Roger Foust has faithfully served the Lord in Moose Jaw.  He came here directed of the Lord to begin a ministry where none existed.

Over those 35 years he has fulfilled the Scriptural injunction to "commit the same to faithful men" and the Word has literally gone around the world because of the faithfulness and mentoring he has provided over the years.

May we all be counted faithful as we preach and teach others so that they may do the same.

Join us as we celebrate 35 years of faithful ministry and are challenged to be faithful wherever the Lord has placed us.  

And may we ever "put them in remembrance" to "rightly divide the Word of truth."

## Speaker 

Bill Jenkin III and his wife, Terri, joined Continental Baptist Missions as missionary church planters in 1983, though their ties to the Mission run much deeper. Both Bill and Terri came to know Christ through the ministry of a CBM mission church, and in a sense are second-generation missionaries, following in the footsteps of their spiritual "parents." After joining the Mission, the Jenkins considered church planting in their home state of Montana, but God saw fit to lead them elsewhere.

For over 21 years, by His grace, Bill and Terri had the privilege of establishing and nurturing four churches to graduation in the Sunshine State of Florida. In the winter of 2004, Bill stepped into the newly created office of Vice President and Director of Church Relations for CBM, a position which gave him the opportunity to represent the Mission and share what God was doing through North American church planting efforts. In May of 2006, he accepted the call to become CBM’s sixth president and continues to serve in this capacity, ministering to the needs of CBM missionaries and the local church alike.
