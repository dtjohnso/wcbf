## Message from Pastor Kevin

Dear Fellow Pastors,

It is a joy and privilege to be partners in the Gospel with you in Western Canada. The ministry is certainly a source of blessing for us, but it can also bring discouragement at times. The apostle Paul looked forward to being refreshed by individual brothers (2 Tim 1:16) and local churches (Rom 15:32). He also commended local churches for refreshing the spirit of the Lord's ministers (2 Cor 7:13). I am eagerly anticipating our time of spiritual refreshment at the annual pastors' conference. The folks at Meadowlands are looking forward to encouraging you and your family. I am especially thrilled to have the Taylors as our guest speakers. I know you will be blessed by their ministry. In addition to our main sessions, Dean will be speaking directly to the pastors, and Faith will be speaking to the wives. We will also have childcare and activities for your children. Mark your calendars now, and prepare to be refreshed!

Kevin Williams

## Our Speakers

Dr. Dean Taylor is Chair of the Ministries Division and of the Pastoral Training Program at Faith Baptist Bible College in Ankeny, Iowa. After serving in the pastorate, his mission at this stage in life is to equip men for ministry, encourage pastors, and strengthen churches.

Faith Taylor loves to teach, explaining the Word of God as it practically applies to the lives of ladies, and sharing with them His working in her own life. She is the author of *A Look Within,* a women's Bible study book and of *Pray for Him,* a prayer booklet for ministry wives.

Dean and his wife, Faith, have four adult children and two grandchildren.
