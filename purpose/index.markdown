The Western Canada Baptist Fellowship is a regional association of pastors committed to a united testimony and service for Jesus Christ.Â  Members range from Manitoba to British Columbia.

The purpose of the WCBF is stated in our constitution, Article II, Section 1:

> The purpose shall be to provide fellowship among the Baptist pastors and missionaries of western Canada that are in full agreement with the doctrinal statement set forth in ARTICLE II, SECTION 2, and to stimulate a common vision, a common enthusiasm and a common commitment among the brethren in the advancement of the common task of evangelistic and missionary endeavors.

This fellowship was conceived out of a burden to serve local assemblies, and especially their pastors. However, we are keenly aware of the danger of infringing on the autonomy of local churches, and wish to minimize our organizational structure so as to avoid that danger. Each year the fellowship sponsors conferences, retreats, camps and special preaching services to encourage the brethren and to help adjust our focus on Jesus Christ in these days of apostasy and degeneracy.
