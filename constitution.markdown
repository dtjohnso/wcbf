## ARTICLE I (NAME)

The name of this organization shall be the WESTERN CANADA BAPTIST FELLOWSHIP (hereafter WCBF).

## ARTICLE II (PURPOSE)

### SECTION 1.

The purpose shall be to provide fellowship among the Baptist churches, pastors and missionaries of western Canada that are in full agreement with the doctrinal statement set forth in ARTICLE II, SECTION 2, and to stimulate a common vision, a common enthusiasm and a common commitment among fellowshipping churches in the advancement of the common task of evangelistic and missionary endeavours.

We believe that Scriptural fellowship encourages believers to live a holy life in submission to the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, that it promotes a godly forbearance of each other’s’ differences of conviction, and that it is marked by a desire to hold one another willingly accountable in love to live godly in Christ Jesus until He comes. It is the purpose of the WCBF to promote such fellowship.

We believe that a limited organizational structure is needed to provide fellowship among Biblical, Baptistic, separatist local churches, to unite the testimony of our churches in these days of apostasy and departure from the clear teachings of the Scriptures, to protect our churches from the ecumenical movement and from possible future government action against “Isolationist” churches, and to oppose the spread of New Evangelicalism and Charismaticism while ensuring each local congregation of full liberty and autonomy.

### SECTION 2.

We adopt the following Doctrinal Statement:

1\. We believe that the Bible, sixty-six books in the Old and New Testaments, is without error in its original writing, that its author was God using Spirit-guided men, and that it is verbally and plenarily inspired, the only authority for faith and conduct.
(Prov. 30:5,6; John 17:17; II Peter 1:19-21; Acts 3:21; Heb. 1:1-3; II Sam. 23:2; I Cor. 2:13,14; II Tim. 3:15-16; Matt. 5:18; II Peter 3:15-16; Acts 17:11; I John 4:1)

2\. We believe that there is one, and only one, living and true God, an infinite, eternal, self-existing, perfect Spirit. He is a personal Being, the creator and upholder of the universe. In the unity of the Godhead there are three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, who are equal in every divine perfection but having distinct work.
(Deut. 6:4,5; Jer. 10:10; John 4:24; James 1:17; Heb. 3:4; Ps. 139:1-16; Matt. 28:19; Matt. 3:16; Ps. 2:2; Isa. 63:10; John 10:30; Phil. 2:5,6; I Cor. 8:6; John 3:16; John 15:26)

3\. We believe in Jesus Christ, the eternal and only begotten Son of God, very deity Himself, conceived by the Holy Spirit, of virgin birth, who assumed human nature without sin and lived a perfect life, shed His precious blood on the cross, arose bodily from the grave, and ascended to reign in heaven. We believe in His personal, pre-tribulational, pre-millennial appearance to rapture the church, His bride. His righteous judgments will then be poured out on an unbelieving world until the physical return of Jesus Christ to the earth in great glory to introduce His earthly reign in the Davidic kingdom, during which Satan will be bound and the curse will be lifted from the physical creation for a millennium. Following the judgment the bodies and souls of the wicked shall be reunited and cast into the Lake of Fire.
(Acts 1:10,11; Acts 2:22,36; Matt. 1:18; Phil. 2:5-11; Col. 1:14; John 1:12,13; John 17:1-26; II Cor. 5:8; I Cor. 15:51-57; Titus 2:13; I Thess. 4:14-17; Matt. 24:21; Rev. 19:11-16; Rom.11:26,27; Rev. 20:2,3,11-15)

4\. We believe in the Holy Spirit whose work it is to convince the world of sin, of righteousness and of judgment, and to regenerate the sinner and seal, indwell, empower, comfort, and sanctify those who believe in Jesus Christ as their Saviour. We do not believe that “speaking in tongues” is a sign of regeneration, or receiving the Holy Spirit, or of sanctification, nor is the New Testament gift of tongues evident today, but has ceased.
(John 14:16,17,26; John 15:26; John 16:8-11; Acts 5:3,4; Acts 5:30-32; Rom. 8:14,16,27; I Cor. 12:13; Eph. 4:30; Eph. 5:17,18; II Pet. 1:20,21)

5\. We believe in the Genesis account of Creation and that it is to be accepted literally and not figuratively. We believe that the six days of creation were solar, twenty-four hour days; that all animal and vegetable life was made directly and God’s established law is that they bring forth only “after their kind,” that man was created directly in God’s own image and after His own likeness without evolving from any lower form of life.
(Gen. 1:26-28; Gen 2:7,18-24; Matt. 19:4; I Thess. 5:23)

6\. We believe that man, although created without sin, by one transgression fell so that all mankind are now sinners by state, disposition, choice, and act and are justly under condemnation. To everyone the blessings of salvation are freely offered in the Gospel, and it is the duty of everyone to accept Jesus Christ as Saviour by penitent and obedient faith. We believe that all who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ are justified, their sin is forgiven and the perfect righteousness of Christ is imputed to them. They are regenerated (born again) and grow in grace; they shall persevere to the end and shall rejoice forever in the presence of our great God.
(Gen. 3:1-24; Gen 5:3; Eph. 2:3; Rom. 3:23; Rom. 5:12; Rom. 1:18; Rom. 3:19; Rom. 3:24; Rom. 6:23; John 3:16-18; John 6:28,29; Acts 16:30,31; Eph. 2:8,9; I John 5:13; Gal. 3:26; John 5:24; Eph. 1:3; II Pet. 1:3; John 10:27-30)

7\. We believe that a local, visible church is a congregation of baptized believers associated together by a common faith and fellowship in the gospel, observing the ordinances of Christ and governed by His Word, seeking to extend the Gospel to the ends of the earth, and that its only Scriptural officers are pastors and deacons whose qualifications, claims and duties are defined in the Epistles to Timothy and Titus.
(Heb. 10:25; Acts 2:41-47; Matt. 28:20; I Cor. 11:17-22; I Cor. 1:2)

8\. We believe that the local visible church of Christ is a voluntary and independent autonomous group of baptized believers; that it is an obedient theocracy which organically must be free from interference by any ecclesiastical or political authority or patronage, and that it has the power and right within itself to confess its own faith in accordance with the New Testament. Each congregation recognizes its own self-contained government, obedient to the Holy Scriptures as its highest authority for carrying out the will of the Lord Jesus Christ who is its head.
(Matt. 18:15-18; I Cor. 5:4,5,13; I Tim. 3:15; Jude 3; Rev. 2 and 3; Acts 6:3-5)

9\. We believe the Scriptures teach total and complete separation from all forms of heresy and ecclesiastical apostasy such as is seen within the World Council of Churches and its Canadian Council of Churches, the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada, the Charismatic Movement, and others. The Scriptures teach that we are to try them, mark them, rebuke them, have no fellowship, withdraw ourselves, have no company with them, and separate from them.
(I John 4:1; Rom. 16:17; Titus 1:13; Eph. 5:11; II Thess. 3:6,14; II John 10,11; II Cor. 6:17; Titus 3:10)
